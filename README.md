# Shadcn UI Component Customizer

A web application that transforms standard shadcn/ui components into highly customized, visually appealing UI elements using AI.

## Features

- **Prompt-Based Customization**: Input a description and get a customized component
- **AI-Powered Design Modification**: Changes colors, spacing, typography, layout, and more
- **Real-Time Preview**: See changes instantly as you adjust your prompts
- **Export & Integration**: Download Tailwind CSS styles or shadcn/ui component JSX

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/bun
- OpenAI API key (for AI-powered customization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shadcn-ui-customizer.git
   cd shadcn-ui-customizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   VITE_GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY=your_google_fonts_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

## Implementing Real AI Integration

This project is set up to use real AI for component generation. Here's how to implement it:

### 1. Set Up Your API Keys

1. Get an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

### 2. Understanding the AI Implementation

The app uses OpenAI's API to:

1. **Analyze Design Inspirations**: Extract color palettes, typography, and design patterns
2. **Generate Unique Components**: Create custom React components based on user prompts

Key files:
- `src/services/openAIService.ts`: Contains the OpenAI API integration
- `src/services/designGenerationService.ts`: Handles component generation
- `src/services/DesignInspirationService.ts`: Manages design inspiration analysis

### 3. Extending the AI Capabilities

To enhance the AI capabilities:

1. **Add More Component Types**:
   - Update the component templates in `designGenerationService.ts`
   - Add new component options in `AIPromptInput.tsx`

2. **Improve Prompt Engineering**:
   - Refine the system prompts in `openAIService.ts` to get better results
   - Add more context about design principles and accessibility

3. **Implement Design Scoring**:
   - Add a function in `openAIService.ts` to score generated designs
   - Use this to provide feedback to users on design quality

## PRD Implementation Status

Based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD), here's what's implemented:

### Implemented ‚úÖ

- Basic UI structure for component customization
- Design style and color scheme selection
- Component preview system
- Export functionality for generated components
- OpenAI integration for component generation

### Partially Implemented üü°

- Design inspiration generator (mock implementation, needs real API integration)
- Real-time preview (needs optimization)
- Component upload & selection (limited to predefined components)

### Not Yet Implemented ‚ùå

- Team collaboration & sharing
- Automatic aesthetic scoring
- Marketplace for pre-made themes
